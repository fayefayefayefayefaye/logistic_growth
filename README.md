# Question 1
### Introduction to the analysis
The analysis aimed to estimate experimental parameters of a non-linear model using linear equations.
The experiment looked at bacterial population growth and the unknown parameters were: initial population size (*N<sub>0<sub>*), rate of growth (*r*), and carrying capacity (*K*).

Bacterial population growth can be described with the logistic growth model. This is because the bacteria cannot grow infinitely; there are density-dependence factors, e.g. competition and limited resources, that limit population growth and cap the population size at the maximum carrying capacity.

The logistic growth model is a non-linear model. The number of bacterial cells, *N*, at time, *t* is given by:
```math
\begin{equation}
N(t) = \frac{K N_0 e^{rt}}{K-N_0+N_0 e^{rt}}
\end{equation}
```

Visualisation of the logistic growth model shows an S-shaped curve. It shows that initial population growth is exponential and eventually plateaus.

The plot can be transformed by taking logs of N to produce a semi-log plot. Using log(N) linearises the exponential growth by compressing the data that spans several magnitudes. The semi-log plot shows an initial linear relationship and a linear relationship when the line plateaus.

### Results

The parameter esimates for experiment3.csv were:\
*N<sub>0<sub>* = exp(8.517e+00)\
*r* = 4.997e-03\
*K* = 4.998e+09\
